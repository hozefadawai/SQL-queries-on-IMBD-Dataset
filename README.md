# SQL-queries-on-IMBD-Dataset

## About

This GitHub repository contains a SQL project based on the IMDb movie dataset. The project focuses on solving complex queries using SQL to extract meaningful insights from the relational tables within the dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have explored the IMDb movie dataset, which comprises multiple relational tables containing information about movies, actors, directors, genres, and more. The goal of this project is to showcase my SQL skills by solving ten diverse queries that provide valuable information about the dataset.

## Dataset

The IMDb movie dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from [IMDb Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). It includes various tables such as `movies`, `actors`, `directors`, `genres`, `ratings`, and more, which are used to create a rich database for movie-related information.
